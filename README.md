# Git Button for Pivotal

*Git Button* adds a new copy button to Pivotal Tracker. It copy's the code for creating a new branch based on the story name to the clipboard so that it can just be pasted into your terminal. For example, the command will look something like the following.

```
git checkout -b 1234567
```

This code is a work in progress and will become a chrome extension when I'm done with it.
