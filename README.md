# Git Button for Pivotal

*Git Button* adds a new copy button to each story in Pivotal Tracker. It copy's the following code to the clipboard so that it can be pasted into a terminal.

```
git checkout -b 1234567
```

This code is a work in progress and will become a chrome extension when I'm done with it.
